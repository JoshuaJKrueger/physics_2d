I was pretty comfortable with this project, as I have written physics engines before. Although, one thing that was difficult for me was figuring out how to represent what I would normally represent with C++ pointers. For most cases rust pretty much automatically handles it, or will tell you if you are missing a reference or something, however, in my manifold struct I store a mutable reference to an object, and that object can be in multiple manifolds, so I had to use reference counting. The main difficulty came from just not remembering they exist, so with some guidance from Professor Hills, it wasn't too big of a hurdle. As for what I learned, I came across several ways to improve this engine upon ones that I had previously written, for example using the Semi-implicit Euler Method. Ultimately, I feel that this project really honed in my rust skills, and improved my ability overall.
