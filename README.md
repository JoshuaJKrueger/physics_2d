# physics_2d #

This project is a simple physics sandbox implemented in Rust using the [Piston graphics crate](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/graphics). The sandbox simulates basic physics interactions between objects. The main goal is to provide a starting point for experimenting with physics simulations in a 2D environment.
